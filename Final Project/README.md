# CS325 Final Project

## TLS fingerpirnts

This project was designed with the goal of capturing network tracffic to build a graph of various applications and their TLS handshake process. 

## Session Hijacking

The other part was to attempt a session hijacking on TeamViewer using a scapy tool to attempt to find the next seq# and ack#. This proves to be overly complex for the scope of this project and thus a guess of the previous packets captured by WireShark are used. Potentially using data mining methods, better guesses can be made.
